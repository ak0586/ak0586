## Hi there 👋

### 👋 Hi, I’m Ankit  
🌐 **Portfolio**: https://ak0586.github.io/Portfolio/

I’m a **Flutter-focused full-stack software developer** who builds **high-performance, real-time mobile applications** backed by scalable APIs. My core strength lies in crafting **clean, responsive Flutter UIs** and integrating them seamlessly with robust backends using **NestJS** and **FastAPI**.

I’ve designed and shipped multiple **production-ready Flutter apps**, with a strong focus on **state management, API integration, real-time updates, performance optimization**, and **user-centric UI/UX**. My favourite project, **BhuMitra**, is a Flutter-based land area measurement app that replaces days of manual field work with fast, accurate, on-device calculations.

Alongside mobile development, I have experience in **mathematical information retrieval** and **intelligent LaTeX processing**, where I’ve built **symbol-aware parsers**, **custom embedding techniques**, and **clustering algorithms**. This research background strengthens my ability to handle **complex data models, algorithms, and system design**, which directly benefits large-scale Flutter applications.

On the backend, I work with **NestJS** and **FastAPI** to build clean, scalable APIs. I’ve implemented features like **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to stream real-time progress updates (e.g., live download tracking) and have built a **Flutter Weather Forecast app** using the OpenWeatherMap API that displays real-time **temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure** for any city or village.

I enjoy writing **pragmatic, maintainable code** and turning complex requirements into elegant Flutter experiences—whether it’s a research-driven tool or a production-ready mobile app.

Outside of coding, you’ll find me **travelling** or playing **cricket**.
