## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ankit

Iâ€™m a full-stack software developer specializing in **mathematical information retrieval** and **intelligent LaTeX processing**. My work revolves around building systems that make mathematical content searchable, structured, and machine-readable. Iâ€™ve developed custom **embedding techniques**, **symbol-aware parsers**, and **clustering algorithms** that bridge the gap between symbolic math and modern ML workflows.

Iâ€™m equally at crafting **real-time Flutter apps** with NestJS backendsâ€”like YouTube downloaders that stream live download progress using Server-Sent Events and **Weather Forecast app** with OpenWeathMap API which shows real-time weather information(including **Temperature, Humidity, WindSpeed, Pressure**) of any city or village by entering in search bar.

Proficient in **C++**, **Python**, **Dart**, **TypeScript**, and frameworks like **Flutter** and **NestJS**, I love solving deep, technical problems and turning complexity into clarity. My code is pragmatic, clean, and driven by purposeâ€”whether itâ€™s a research tool or a production-ready app.

Outside of work, youâ€™ll find me exploring new places or on the cricket field.
